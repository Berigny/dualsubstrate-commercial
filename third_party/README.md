# Third-party protobuf definitions

The files under `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` are vendored from
[grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)
version v2.19.0 so the generated Python stubs can import the
`protoc_gen_openapiv2.options` package at runtime. See the upstream project for
licensing information.
